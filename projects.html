<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Software from Papers</h3>
<dl><dd>




<a href="QKDPracAtk.html">Genetic Algorithm to Study Practical Quantum Adversaries</a> Full source code for our genetic algorithms.  Tested on Linux
<p>
<a href="QKDOpt.html">Automatic Generation of Optimal Quantum Key Distribution Protocols:</a> Full source code for our genetic algorithms.  Tested on Linux and Mac OS.
<p>


<a href="math/QKDEvolve.html">A Genetic Algorithm to Analyze the Security of Quantum Cryptographic Protocols:</a> Full source code for our GA to analyze quantum protocols.  Includes the ability to write QKD protocols in a (relatively) easy to use language of our design.  Tested on Linux.
<p>

<a href="math/cgt.html">n-Player Impartial Combinatorial Games with Random Players:</a> Some notes and software we used to analyze the games.
<p>


<a href="robots/qdm.html">On the Application of Quantum Decision Theory to Artificial Life:</a> This is old work and old software.  But it should still work.  You may also be interested in my robot simulator: <a href="robots/srs10.html">Simple Robot Sim 2010.</a>
<p>

<a href="robots/enn.html">On the Emergent Behaviors of a Robot Controlled by a Real-Time Evolving Neural Network:</a> Again, older work, but it should still run.
<p>


<a href="math/QuantumOp.html">An Algorithm for Evolving Multiple Quantum Operators for Arbitrary Quantum Computational Problems:</a> Source code.
<p>

<a href="qprog/index.html">Simulating Quantum Algorithms with Q-Prog.</a>
